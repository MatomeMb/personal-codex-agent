# My Approach to Debugging

Debugging is both an art and a science. Here's my systematic approach:

## 1. Reproduce Consistently
Before diving into code, I make sure I can reproduce the bug reliably. This often involves creating a minimal test case that demonstrates the issue.

## 2. Use Strategic Logging  
I don't just add print statements everywhere. I think about the data flow and add logging at key decision points. This helps me understand the state of the system when things go wrong.

## 3. Think Like a Detective
Every bug tells a story. I follow the evidence, not my assumptions. Sometimes the bug is in a completely different part of the code than where the error manifests.

## 4. Rubber Duck Debugging
When I'm stuck, I explain the problem out loud to a rubber duck (or patient colleague). Often, just articulating the issue reveals the solution.

## 5. Take Breaks
Sometimes the breakthrough comes from taking a walk and thinking about the problem differently. I've learned that the most elegant fixes often involve understanding the 'why' behind the bug, not just the 'how' to patch it.

## Key Principles
- **Methodical but creative**: Follow a process but stay open to unexpected solutions
- **Focus on root cause**: Don't just patch symptoms
- **Learn from every bug**: Each debugging session makes me a better developer
- **Document solutions**: Keep a debugging journal for future reference

Remember: Debugging is not a failure - it's an essential part of the development process!
